= Metr Data Parser

This is a small CLI tool that converts link:https://metr.at[] data to a proper, row (item) oriented JSON file.
The default raw Metr data is horribly structured, and does not feed well into visualization tools like Vega.

== Requirements

You must have Python 3 installed.

== Usage

Simply run

    python3 metr_parser.py input_file.json out_file.json

You can also give the link to a Metr record directly:

    python3 metr_parser.py https://metr.at/r/1q2w3e4r out_file.json
